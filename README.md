Cell Phone Data Plan


Consider a cell phone provider with three different data plans.

Plan A: $30 per month, 250MB included. $10 per 250MB above that. 
Plan B: $40 per month, 1GB included. $10 per 500MB above that.
Plan C: $65 per month, 6GB included. $10 per 1GB above that.

This program prompts the user to enter their plan letter and then the total number of GBs of data they used that month. If the total data used was less than 0GB, the program quites immediately. Otherwise, it will compute and display their total charges.
